### Hi there 👋

- 🛠️ Budget dev boards are my playground, with the [Orange Pi Zero 3](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-Zero-3.html), [Orange Pi Zero 2w](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-Zero-2W.html) and [LicheeRV Nano](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/RV_Nano/1_intro.html) being my favorites!
