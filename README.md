### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am Zijun Yang, an undergraduate majoring in CS at UMich and ECE at UM-SJTU Joint Institute.
- 👨‍💻 I worked on [XuanTie Linux System Platform](https://www.xrvm.com/soft-tools/os/Linux) at [DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?language=en) Alibaba Inc.
- 🛠️ Budget dev boards are my playground, with the [Orange Pi Zero 3](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-Zero-3.html) and [LicheeRV Nano](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/RV_Nano/1_intro.html) being my favorites!
  - There was a time when the topology looks like this: Web Server on LicheeRV Nano <-- ssh -L --> Orange Pi Zero 3 <-- frp --> My VPS <-- Cloudflare Proxy --> Client.
- </> To humans, I speak Mandarin and English; to silicon, I speak (modern) C++ (for 10+ years), C, C#, Python (Django and Streamlit framework), MATLAB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Vue framework. 
- ⚡ This is [my website](https://zjyang.dev/) in which you can find a short list of my projects.
